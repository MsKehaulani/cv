        <p>
          I worked for a total of four (4) Savio Group Companies for nearly a decade and within that time acquired vast knowledge in property management and real estate in both the local Hawaii and national level.
          After years of trying various roles within the Savio Group, I realized I still wasn't satisfied with staying in that industry.
        </p>
        <p>
          Last year, I slowly switched gears and started to learn how to code after a conversation with a friend.
          Nostalgia struck and prompted me to visualize a time in my tweens when I would update my Friendster and then my MySpace profile with glitter graphics, cheeky images and TyPiNg Up MaH BiO WiT aLtErNaTiNg CaPs (ugh...closes eyes, slowly takes
          a deep breath in and releases a big sigh...).
          Little did I know that by spending hours of my weekends and school nights to structure and style my profile page with HTML and CSS would leave a lasting impression behind.
          That those hours spent tinkering with anchor and style tags to personalize my profile was an introduction to code.
          A light bulb moment happened and I realized that nearly 20 years ago, coding had brought forth my creative spark and challenged me.
          It was a means to solving a problem, the tool I used to express something about myself or my interpretation of the world and the joy of just experimenting and seeing what happened with the understanding that there is always room for
          improvement.
          So as I go and pursue my first job in tech, it is not the big names of corporate giants or the money to be made in the industry that drives me.
          What drives me forward with perseverance is the opportunity and ability I have to create with code and the joy and excitement I feel when I remember that though I am not the best, that there is always so much out there to learn and abundant
          opportunities for growth.
